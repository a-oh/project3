## Executive Summary
We've all seen them. We know they are clickbait. Yet, we find ourselves clicking the Buzzfeed article with the title, "20 mindblowing inventions that will change your life forever!" The sensationalist tactics are not a new concept, and they have long been around since the time of newspapers to manipulate readers' desire to consume more just by reading the headlines. 

In marketing, clickthrough-rate is a widely used metric that measures how well your keyword or particular ad is performing. It is calculated by the number of clicks out of the total number of exposure, and the higher number means your product is performing well. For news articles, having an enticing title is essential. So, what makes them enticing? 

Using Natural Language Processing, we can answer this question by studying the titles from highly popular articles. NLP models can be used to look for unique characteristics shared by the titles and use these features to predict which subreddit each post originates from. 

The current model predicts with about 85% accuracy when the baseline is 50%. By further investigating the coefficients of the models, we can gain additional insights into which words are more impactful for determining the origin of subreddit. 

We would love to work with you to improve how you title your articles and raise the CTR. Please connect with me through my email to discuss more.
